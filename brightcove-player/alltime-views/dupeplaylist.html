    <h1>Duplicated Playlist</h1>
    <p>The playlist has 9 items - scroll down the list here, and you'll that the 9 are all duplicated to create 18 total. Compare <a href="singleplaylist.html">Single Playlist Sample</a>. The only difference between the two is that in this page, I have modified the in-page embed code from Studio in the other page by moving the &gt;ol&lt; tag for the playlist <strong>above</strong> the player script tag.</p>
    <p>My best guess as to what's going on is that the script looks for ol tag, and since it loads first, doesn't find it, and generates one instead (in addition to one that loads after the script).</p>
