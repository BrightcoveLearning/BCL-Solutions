  Version 2.2.6:

    Changes:

        the ad request returns successfully and to reuse the previous
        AdContext if available when an ad request fails.
      * Upgraded FreeWheel AdManager library to 5.5.3.  As a result, removed
        AdManagerLoader library and it's use.

        throws an error when resumed after the midroll.
