- Moved CSS into a separate file
- Added ability to localize the months, weekdays and suffixes via the configuration
- Added minified version of the datepickr code

2012-12-03 ::: v2.0

- Rewrote most of the code base
- Datepickr can now be used more than once on the same page
- Started to implement functionality to show datepickr by clicking on an icon instead of an input
- File size is over 10KB now, but releasing anyways. I will work on cutting it down, if possible.
