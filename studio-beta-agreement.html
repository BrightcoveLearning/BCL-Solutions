<h1>VIDEO CLOUD STUDIO BETA AGREEMENT</h1>

<p>This Beta Agreement (“Beta Agreement”), by and between Brightcove Inc. (“Brightcove”) and the entity or individual (“Company”) identified in the online Video Cloud Studio Beta Application the “Application”), is effective on the date Company submits its Application online to Brightcove by clicking the “Submit” button on the Application form (the “Effective Date”). If you are an individual and are entering into this Beta Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to all of the terms and conditions of this Beta Agreement.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>The Beta Service</strong>. Brightcove has developed and continues to develop its new Video Cloud Studio (the “Beta Service”), which enables users to upload, manage, publish, and delete videos and their associated data as well as create, manage, and publish video players. Company agrees that the right to use the Beta Service is for testing and evaluation purposes only, and any use of the Beta Service in any production or public facing environment is at its own risk. Brightcove will not charge Company any fees for Company’s use of the Beta Service during the Term. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any Streams and/or Bandwidth used by Company in connection with its use of the Beta Service will, upon notice, be counted against Company’s Stream Limit and Bandwidth Limit (as set forth and defined in Company’s current Brightcove Service agreement). This Beta Agreement does not convey any right, title or interest in or to the Beta Service, any software used therein, or any associated intellectual property rights. Company acknowledges the Beta Service is still in development and that it might contain technical, operational, security and other errors and limitations. Brightcove may (but is not required to) provide reasonable support for the Beta Service; Company expressly understands and agrees that there is no service level agreement associated with the Beta Service and Brightcove will not continually monitor the Beta Service. Company agrees that it will not: (a) sublicense, resell, transfer, assign, use for any reason competitive to Brightcove, distribute or otherwise commercially exploit or make available to any third party the Beta Service or any part thereof in any way; (b) modify or make derivative works based upon the Beta Service or reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Beta Service; (c) use the Beta Service in any illegal or unlawful manner or for any illegal or unlawful purpose; or (d) perform any act which interferes with or disrupts the Beta Service.</li>
    
    
    <li><strong>Beta Term</strong>. The term of this Beta Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and will expire on the first day Brightcove makes the Beta Service generally commercially available to the public (the “Term”), provided however that Brightcove may terminate this Beta Agreement in its sole discretion at any time upon delivery of notice of termination (by email or other written communication) to Company. Upon any termination or expiration of this Beta Agreement, Company will cease use of the Beta Service. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Brightcove shall determine if and/or when, following the Effective Date, Company may have access to the Beta Service. Depending on various factors, not all applicants may be given access to the Beta Service.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>.

THE BETA SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS ONLY. EXCEPT AS MAY OTHERWISE BE REQUIRED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BRIGHTCOVE BE LIABLE TO COMPANY UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA OR CONTENT, LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR OTHER DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, ARISING FROM OR IN RELATION TO THIS BETA AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE BETA SERVICE.
        </li>    
<li><strong>Indemnification</strong>. Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Brightcove and its officers, employees, directors, agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors and assigns from and against any and all third party claims, damages, liabilities, loss, government fines, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and litigation expenses) (each a “Claim”), arising out of or related to any alleged or actual breach of this Beta Agreement by Company.
