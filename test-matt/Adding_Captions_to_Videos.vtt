00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm Bob Bailey, a Learning
Specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.820 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll
learn how to add captions

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.010 align:middle line:84%
to a video using the
Brightcove player.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Closed captions can be
added to your videos

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.480 align:middle line:84%
to provide additional or
interpretive information

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:84%
to individuals who
wish to access it.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Captions are necessary so
the deaf and hard of hearing

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
can access the audio portion
of video presentations.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
There are three basic steps
to add captions to a video.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:84%
First, you need to create a
caption file for your video.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:84%
You'll need a
separate caption file

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:84%
for each language
you want to support.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Second, you need to modify
the In-Page embed code

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
for the player to
include the track tag.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:84%
The track tag is used to
specify the captions that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
should be visible as
the video is playing.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Finally, you may want
to style the captions

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
to change the font, colors,
or location of the captions.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.482 align:middle line:90%
Let's get started.

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we
need are caption files

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
for all the languages
we want to support.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:84%
The Brightcove player supports
caption files in WebVTT format.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:84%
To create a caption
file, you can

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
use one of the many
third-party software packages

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:84%
or in my case, I
uploaded one of my videos

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:84%
to one of our
partners, 3Play Media.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
They're just one of our partners
that provide transcription,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.596 align:middle line:84%
captioning, and
translation services.

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:84%
For a complete
list of Brightcove

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.667 align:middle line:84%
partners visit Brightcove.com
and click on the Partners link.

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I've already gone
ahead and downloaded

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:84%
the WebVTT caption files
from the 3Play Media website.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
For this video, I want to add
English and French captions

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to my video so I have
two caption files.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you'll have
a separate WebVTT file

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
for each language
you want to support.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:84%
If I open one of
the caption files,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
you can see it has time
markings and the text

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
to be displayed
during that time.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have
caption files, we'll

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
get the in-page embed
code for the player

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and then modify
it add track tags.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.062 align:middle line:84%
To do this, I'll start by
going to the Players module.

00:02:13.062 --> 00:02:14.895 align:middle line:84%
I've already created a
player and associated

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:84%
a video from my Video Cloud
account with the player.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
To get the in-page
embed code, I'll

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
click on the embed
code and URL button

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:90%
and select Published Player.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to copy the
in-page embed code

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and paste it into
my HTML editor.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Now I need to
modify the video tag

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
to include a track tag for
each caption file I have.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
track tag, I'm going

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
to specify what kind of
track it is, captions,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and then specify the
location of where

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:90%
the caption file is located.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.449 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that Brightcove
does not host caption files,

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:84%
so you'll need to
host them somewhere

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:90%
once they are created.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Next, I'll specify the source
language and the label.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
The label will be
displayed to the user

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to allow them to
select this language.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Notice that I have
two track tags, one

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.720 align:middle line:84%
for the English captions and the
other for the French captions.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
When I'm done, I'll save
the page, and then upload.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.541 align:middle line:84%
Let's test this to make sure
the captions are working.

00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll open my page in a
browser and play the video.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Notice there is a CC button
as part of the player chrome.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
If I hover over that, I
can select the language

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:90%
to display the captions.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.340 align:middle line:84%
There are a few options
available for styling

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:90%
the captions.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:84%
First, it is possible to
add tags to the WebVTT

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:84%
file directly to
control the layout

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:90%
and position of the captions.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
You can also style the
captions using CSS.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Both of these
methods are covered

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:90%
in the caption documentation.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Viewers also have the ability to
style the captions themselves.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:84%
For viewers on desktop
and Android devices,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a Caption
Settings menu, which

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:84%
viewers can select to customize
the style of the captions.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:84%
If I select it,
an overlay appears

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
allowing me to change
colors, opacity,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:90%
font size, and font family.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
The Defaults button will
restore the default settings.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
For viewers on iOS
devices, caption styling

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
is controlled through
the iOS settings.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
If I go to my iOS device and
select Settings, General,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Accessibility, Subtitles
and Captioning, Style,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I can select a pre-defined
style or create new styles.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I've already created
a custom style,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.700 align:middle line:90%
so I'm going to select it.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:84%
When I return to
my video, I can see

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:84%
the styles applied
to the captions.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:11.844 align:middle line:90%
